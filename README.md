# Single vs Multi-Threaded Processing Comparison

This project demonstrates the difference between single-threaded and multi-threaded processing in JavaScript/Node.js.

## Overview

The application runs two different processing methods:

1. Single-threaded processing
2. Multi-threaded processing

This allows for a comparison of performance and efficiency between the two approaches.

## Files

- `src/main.js`: The main entry point of the application.
- `src/singleThreaded.js`: Contains the implementation for single-threaded processing.
- `src/multiThreaded.js`: Contains the implementation for multi-threaded processing.

## Usage

To run the application:

This will execute both the single-threaded and multi-threaded processes sequentially and display the results.

## Implementation Details

- The `runSingleThreaded()` function in `singleThreaded.js` handles the single-threaded processing.
- The `runMultithread()` function in `multiThreaded.js` manages the multi-threaded processing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `npm install` (if there are any dependencies)

## Results

After running the application, you will see the output from both processing methods, allowing you to compare their performance.
